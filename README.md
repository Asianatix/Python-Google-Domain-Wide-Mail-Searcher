# Python-Google-Domain-Wide-Mail-Searcher
Python based Google Mail Domain Wide search for Google Apps at Work

I developed this for a work assignment.  It took, in my opinion, way too long to cobble the various Google references to find workable code and configuration that allowed you to search your entire domain for a list of mail items, so I'm putting it all here in hopes it helps someone in the future.  Redacted screenshots to follow.
